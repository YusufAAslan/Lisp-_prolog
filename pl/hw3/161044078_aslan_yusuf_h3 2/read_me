how to compile ?

For compiling :
At first  pass this code to terminal

	swipl -s 161044078_aslan_yusuf_h3.pl 

Then:
for part 1: I wrote  the data base of room information and instructor and time and courses names
and the capacity	


for part 2: I wrote knowldege base about cities and facts about coste between them and rules

first part of part 2:
It shows the direct flights true or false .
	
the rest of part 2:
I  used  the refference https://www.cpp.edu/~jrfisher/www/prolog_tutorial/2_15A.pl  for this portion of code and  tried to change it according to desired input & outputs.
	
to test part 2 :  for example write flight(istanbul,izmir). and enter and it will says if there is flight then True, if not it will says false
